# Google Play — Data Safety form answers

This is a fill-in-the-blanks guide for the Data safety section in Play Console
(**App content → Data safety**). Google cross-checks these answers against what
your app actually does and rejects mismatches, so there are **two scenarios**
below. Use the one that matches the build you're actually shipping.

> Not legal advice. This reflects how the app is built; a lawyer/DPO should

> backend is live.

## Which scenario am I in?

- **Scenario A — Local-only build** (`js/firebase-config.js` still has the
  placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY`): the app sends nothing off the device. Everything
  is in the browser's localStorage.
- **Scenario B — Firebase enabled** (real config filled in, cloud accounts +
  sync live): names, notes, signatures and an account email are transmitted to
  and stored in Firebase (Google Cloud), and purchase data is handled for
  subscriptions.

Ship the answers for the scenario you actually launch with. If you launch local-
only and later switch on Firebase, **you must update this form the same day** —
this is one of the most common causes of enforcement action.

## Scenario A — Local-only build

**Top-level questions**
- Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? → **No.**
  - Justification: Google's definition of "collected" is *data transmitted off
    the device*. In this build nothing is transmitted — there is no server and
    no analytics/ads SDK. On-device-only storage is explicitly excluded from
    "collected."
- (The rest of the form is skipped once you answer No, but keep the note below
  on file in case of review.)

**Review note to keep:** All user-entered data (names, notes, on-screen
signatures, the local login) is stored only in `localStorage` on the user's
device. No advertising SDK, no analytics SDK, no crash-reporting SDK, no network
calls. The Backup/Restore feature writes a file to the user's own device at their
request; it is not transmitted anywhere by the app.

## Scenario B — Firebase enabled (accounts + cloud sync + subscriptions)

**Top-level questions**
- Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? → **Yes.**
- Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? → **Yes.**
  (Firebase/Firestore and Google Play Billing all use HTTPS/TLS by default.)
- Do you provide a way for users to request that their data be deleted? → **Yes.**
  (In-app: users can delete individual assessments/permits and use "Erase all
  local data"; for full account deletion, provide the account-deletion path
  Google now requires — see the note at the bottom.)

**Data types to declare** — for each, Google asks: *Collected? Shared? Processed
ephemerally? Optional or required? Purposes?* Recommended answers:

| Data type | Collected | Shared | Purpose(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal info → Name** | Yes | No | App functionality | Assessor / issuer / approver / verifier / person-in-charge / contractor names entered on assessments and permits. |
| **Personal info → Email address** | Yes | No | App functionality; Account management | Used as the cloud account login identifier (Firebase Auth). |
| **Personal info → User IDs** | Yes | No | App functionality; Account management | Firebase Auth UID; ties records to the account. |
| **Personal info → Other info** | Yes | No | App functionality | Free-text notes and on-screen **signatures** captured for permit sign-off. Declare here (there is no dedicated "signature" type) and describe it in the field. |
| **Financial info → Purchase history** | Yes | No | App functionality; Account management | Subscription purchase/entitlement state from Google Play Billing, used to unlock paid features. Payment *card* data is handled entirely by Google Play and is **not** collected by your app — do not tick "User payment info". |
| **App activity / App info & performance** | No* | — | — | Only tick these if you later add analytics or crash reporting. The base app doesn't. |

*Leave analytics/crash-reporting rows as "not collected" unless and until you
actually add Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics — if you add them, revisit this.

**"Shared" is No across the board** in this design: data goes to Firebase as your
*processor* (that's "collected/processed on your behalf," not "shared with a third
party" in Google's sense). Don't tick Shared just because Firebase is Google —
Google-as-your-backend is still processing on your behalf.

**Security practices section**
- Data is encrypted in transit → **Yes.**
- Users can request data deletion → **Yes** (see account-deletion note below).
- Committed to Play Families Policy? → only if you target children (you don't;
  this is a professional tool).

## Account deletion requirement (Scenario B)

Google requires apps with account creation to also offer **account deletion**,
and to give a way to request it *without reinstalling the app* — typically a web
URL. Practically, add either:
- an in-app "Delete my account & data" button that deletes the Firebase Auth user
  and their Firestore `users/{uid}` document (a small Cloud Function using the
  Admin SDK does this cleanly), and/or
- a public web page describing how to request deletion, whose URL you enter in
  Play Console's **App content → Data deletion** section.

**Built now:** `account-deletion.html` is the public deletion page. It is
deliberately *not* behind `requireAuth()`, because Google requires the URL to be
reachable without signing in or installing the app. It covers all three routes —
wiping everything on the device (including the offline cache and the registered
service worker), uninstalling, and emailing to request deletion of a cloud
account and its synced records — and states the 30-day completion commitment and
what may be retained for statutory accounting reasons.

Enter its hosted URL in **Play Console → App content → Data deletion**.

Still to do for a Scenario-B launch: wire the emailed request to an actual
deletion path — a small Cloud Function using the Firebase Admin SDK that deletes
the Auth user and their Firestore documents. The page promises 30 days; make sure
something can actually deliver that.

## Privacy policy URL

Both scenarios: enter the hosted URL of `privacy.html` in Play Console. Google
requires a working, app-specific privacy policy link for any app that offers
accounts or in-app purchases.
